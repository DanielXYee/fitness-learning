# Fitness Learning  
----  
A light weight apple watch app with real time recognition of workout categories with pretrained machine learning algorithm. 

## Motivation  
While apple watch provide fitness data monitoring and analysis, it relies on users to manually input the workout category to track. It'll be much more user-friendly if apple watch could automatically detect and categorize the type of workout in the real time. 

## Data  
Data was collected directly from the Apple Watch and with the assitance of a third party application called PowerSense. The data included accelerometer measurements, heart rate and calorie count
